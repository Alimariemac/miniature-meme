This difference between the health of LGBTQ+ people compared to the health of non-LGBTQ+ people is called a “health disparity”.<br><br>LGBTQ+ people experience health disparities, not because we are genetically more unhealthy than non-LGBTQ+ people, but because we experience barriers to health access and gaps in health access that are specific to the LGBTQ+ population. These barriers and gaps mean LGBTQ+ people have a difficult time obtaining the health and wellness services we need. This produces preventable LGBTQ+ health disparities.<br></p>
